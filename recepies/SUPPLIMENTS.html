    <h2>Breaking down your body semantics</h2>
    <p>Several supplements can help support muscle growth when paired with resistance training and a well-rounded diet. This includes creatine and protein supplements, among others.</p>
    <P>If you exercise regularly, you likely want to be sure you're getting the most out of it.</P>
    <p>One important benefit of exercise is gaining muscle and strength. Having a healthy amount of muscle allows you to perform your best during exercise and daily life.</p>
    <p><strong>Main criteria must be met for maximal muscle gain:</strong> </p>
    <ul>
        <li>eating more calories than you burn</li>
        <li>consuming more protein than you break down</li>
        <li>following an exercise program that is challenging to your muscles</li>
        <p>While it's possible to meet all these criteria without taking dietary supplements, certain supplements may help you meet your goals.</p>    
    </ul>
<h3>This article reviews supplements that may help you gain more muscle with your exercise program.</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Creatine</li>
    <li>Protein supplements</li>
    <li>Weight gainers</li>
    <li>Beta-alanine</li>
    <li>Branched-chain amino acids</li>
    <li>Beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate</li>
    <h4>Breaking down into the Suppliments</h4>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Creatine</strong></li>
        <p>Creatine is a molecule naturally produced in your body. It provides energy for your muscles and other tissues.

            Taking it as a dietary supplement can increase muscle creatine content by up to 40%Trusted Source beyond its normal levels.
            
            Creatine affects muscle cells and exercise performance, promoting muscle gain. In fact, a large amount of researchTrusted Source shows creatine improves muscle strength.</p>

        <li><strong>Protien Suppliments</strong></li>    
        <p>Getting enough protein is critical for gaining muscle. Specifically, to gain muscle, you need to consume more protein than your body breaks down through natural processes.

            While it's possible to get all the protein you need from protein-rich foods, some people may struggle to do so. If this sounds like you, you may want to consider taking a protein supplement.
            
            There are many protein supplements available, but some of the most popular are whey, casein, and soy protein. Other supplements contain protein isolated from eggs, split peas, rice, and hemp seeds.</p>
        
        <li><strong>Weight Gainers</strong></li>
        <p>Weight gainers are supplements designed to conveniently help you get more calories and protein. They’re typically used by people who have difficulty gaining muscle, even when consuming large amounts of calories and lifting weights.</p>    
            
        <li><strong>Beta-Alanine</strong></li>
        <p>Beta-alanine is an amino acid that reduces fatigue and may improveTrusted Source exercise performance. Beta-alanine may also help increase muscle mass if you are following an exercise program.</p>

        <li><Strong>Branched-Chain Amino Acids</Strong></li>
        <p>Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) consist of three amino acids: leucine, isoleucine, and valine. They are found in most protein sources, particularly those of animal origin like meat, poultry, eggs, dairy, and fish.</p>

        <li><strong>Beta-hydroxy Beta-methylbutyrate</strong></li>
        <p>Beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a molecule that's produced when your body processes the amino acid leucine.</p>
    </ul>

</ol>
<h4>Personal Opinion</h4>
<P>Many types of supplements claim to increase muscle mass, but there’s little evidence that they are effective for healthy, active individuals.</P>
