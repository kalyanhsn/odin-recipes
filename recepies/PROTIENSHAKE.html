    <h2>Home Made Protein Shake</button> </h2>
    <P>Our go-to protein shake recipe includes frozen fruit, protein powder, almond milk, and Greek yogurt. It's a great starting point to get a decent amount of protein per serving and to make it your own!</P>
    <h3>Ingredients needed for protien shake</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup frozen strawberries and bananas, any kind of fruit works </li>
        <li>1 serving vanilla protein powder, we used Garden of Life Whey </li>
        <li>1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt, we used 2% </li>
        <li>1/2 - 1 cup plain, unsweetened almond milk </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Creation of the above Protien Shake</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add all of the ingredients into a high-speed blender.</li>
        <li>Blend on high for 1 minute, stopping to scrape the sides, if needed. Add more almond milk to thin things out as needed.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3> Personal Opinion</h3>
    <p>feel free to use any kind of frozen fruit such as berries or mango. Any kind of protein powder works (chocolate, plain, vanilla). Instead of almond milk, try oat milk or orange juice.</p>
