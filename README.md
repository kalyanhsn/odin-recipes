# Odin Recipes

This project is a simple recipe book that allows users to display recipes with images, descriptions, and other information. It is part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum, designed to help me learn and practice core web development skills.

### Skills Demonstrated

- **HTML**: I have practiced and enhanced my understanding of basic HTML tags, attributes, and structuring content for the web.
- **CSS**: I have applied styling techniques to create a visually appealing user interface.
- **Responsive Design**: The project will demonstrate the ability to create a mobile-friendly layout.
- **Version Control with Git**: Using Git and GitHub, I have learned how to clone repositories, commit changes, and push updates.
  
This project has helped me solidify the foundations of web development, and I look forward to applying these skills to more complex projects.
